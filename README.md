# Understanding Bank Customer Churn: Why Retention is Key

<img src= "https://github.com/Ananyad7/Bank_Churn_Analysis/assets/164981636/ed2cdf31-c5fb-4851-9134-f7d2d80eb797" width="2550" height="750">

Bank customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers cease their relationship with a bank. This can manifest in several ways, such as:
Closing accounts entirely
Transferring funds to another institution
Discontinuing use of specific banking services

High customer churn acts like a silent leak in a bank's profitability. Here's why it matters:
Costly Acquisitions: Finding new customers is expensive, with marketing and onboarding surpassing the cost of retaining existing ones. Reducing churn keeps these costs in check.
Lost Revenue Streams: Churning customers take their potential future business elsewhere. Retaining them ensures a steady source of income from accounts, loans, and other services.
Damaged Reputation: A revolving door of customers suggests underlying issues. Addressing churn can rebuild trust and attract new customers seeking stability.

By tackling churn, banks can plug the leak and strengthen their financial health.

# Objective
In this report, we delve into the phenomenon of customer churn within banking institutions. Customer churn, or the rate at which customers leave a service or product, is a critical metric for banks to monitor and understand. By analyzing factors influencing churn, banks can develop strategies to retain customers and enhance customer satisfaction.
The primary objective of this report is to explore the dataset containing information about bank customers and their churn status. Through SQL analysis, we aim to identify key factors that contribute to customer churn and provide insights for mitigating churn rates.

The data reveals that churned customers have a significantly higher average account balance at $91,108.5, compared to $72,745.3 for those who have not churned. This suggests potential dissatisfaction among higher-value customers,


# Churn vs. Retention Rate: Tenure
